## 1) Connection to the Database
Please note that, as version 1.0.0, the connection to the database relies on the connection to
Microsoft Azure Cloud Service for MySQL database. A firewall rule must be set prior to enable read & write access to the
cloud database. 

For future references, you can change the database connection by changing the connection information in <mark class="green_marker">application.properties</mark>.
